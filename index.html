<h2> Welcome to Scoffing Escoffier!</h2><br>
<p>Augustus Escoffier was the head chef of the famous London & Paris hotel restaurants at the Savoy, Ritz and Carlton. He wrote one of the most acclaimed
recipe books of the early 20th century, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_guide_culinaire" target="_blank">Le Guide Culinaire (1903)</a>.
<br><br>
Escoffier is renowned as the inventor of the modern kitchen <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade_de_cuisine" target="_blank">brigade system</a>. To this day,
modern professional kitchens are run in this way. Escoffier transformed the notoriously unhygienic, chaotic and heavy-drinking kitchens of the 19th century into a much cleaner, precise machine.
Escoffier put into place the theory of division of labour: giving each kitchen worker a relatively limited scope of duties to focus on, so that they were no longer dividing attention between the oven, grill, sauces, baking, plating and dish-washing simultaneously.<br><br>

Escoffier codified the great 'mother sauces' of French cuisine: bechamel, veloute, espagnole, hollandaise and tomato. 
<h3>Eating Escoffier</h3>
<p>Here I will be recording my experiences of researching, making and most importantly, eating some of the dishes from Escoffier's Le Guide Culinaire.</p>
