<p>I first discovered Escoffier through the writing and television work of acclaimed American chef Antony Bourdain.
    He sung the Frenchman's praises as the great codifier and engineer behind the way that professional kitchens work to this day, over a hundred years since
    Escoffier began to organise his kitchens in this way.<br><br>
    I was intrigued to learn more about the man, and so I purchased a copy of Le Guide Culinaire in 2019. In it, I found a vast and brilliant repository of information and dishes that I had never heard of (chicken poached in pig's bladder, anyone?).
